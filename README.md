# Degree-of-profanity
This programmes calculates the degree of profanity for each line a paragraph by counting no. of racial slurs involved in each word of the text.
It is defined by defining a Python set of racist insults. Then it defines the calculate profanity function, which takes a text as input, breaks it into words, and checks how many of those words are racial insults. The function returns a score representing the sentence's level of profanity. The software then scans each line of the input file. It removes any punctuation from each line using the regular expression re.sub() technique and then calls the calculate profanity function to calculate the sentence's profanity score. Finally, for each line, it prints the original sentence as well as the estimated profanity score.
